# Tech Meeting Write Up
## What was the name of the tech event?

Portland Ruby Brigade
## What date did it occur?

09/04/2018

## Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?
The PDX Ruby Brigade put on the event. It was hosted at New Relic in Downtown Portland. There was a scheduled speaker and two impromptu speakers who did lightning talks.

### The following people spoke:

There were three speakers total, but I do not remember their names.


## What was the format of the event?

The format of the event was a formal presentation, then a lightning talk by someone given short notice, and then another lightning talk given by someone inspired by the previous lightning talk.

## What was the topic or main focus of the event?

The scheduled talk was by a man who created a gem that takes your code and makes a visual representation of the logic. The lightning talks were about security and how to organize your code with this in mind.

## What made you want to attend this particular event?

I really enjoy the Ruby community. I like the way the meetings are run and the people who attend them. The information is always good, so I plan on attending the Ruby Brigade meetups whenever possible.

## What was the highlight of the event?

I really enjoyed the presentation about the gem. It was very interesting to see and hear the process and final result of someones hard work and dedication.


## What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that you can give a talk about something in the tech world even if you are not a senior dev. The speakers encouraged juniors to consider giving talks about things they discover or are looking into.

## If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)

It was interesting to have people give impromptu talks that were inspired by the things other speakers were saying. The group feels very dynamic and welcoming.

## Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?

Definitely, the atmosphere is great for feeling welcome and learning about Ruby related topics.

## Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.

New Relic is a nice place to hang out in.
